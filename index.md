## Welcome to Applied Statistics (LLO8180), Fall 2021

This is a supplementary page for Professor Hartigan's section of LLO 8180 - Applied Statistics. Make sure you bookmark and check this page frequently for the most up-to-date files to use for live sessions and assignments. You should have R and RStudio installed prior to the first day of class. Instructions for installing/updating can be found [here](./Downloading Installing Updating R and RStudio.pdf). Also, we've prepared a slide deck with helpful information for navigating and setting up R, which can be found [here](./Intro to R_final.pptx).

You can find the course syllabus [here](./llo_8180_syllabus.pdf). Additionally, you can find a spreadsheet with all quiz/assignment due dates for the semester [here - updated 9/29/21](./Fall 2021 LLO8180 due dates.xlsx).

If you want to set up email alerts for updates/additions to this site, you can use the free version of a third-party program: [Distill](https://distill.io/). The free version will check for updates every 6 hours and send you alerts. Note: this is a platform that is not owned by Vanderbilt or me and you should review their data privacy and security to ensure you are comfortable with their practices.

### Live Session RStudio (.Rmd) Files
These are the RStudio files and datasets that we will use for our live session meetings each week. While you don't have to run the code in advance of class, some of you might prefer to do so. I will upload all code at least 24 hours before our class meetings.

### Assignments
Each assignment (problem set) is worth 100 points. These should be uploaded to the async before live session on their given due date. All assignment submissions should include two files:
1. Your .Rmd code file
2. Your "knit" assignment file. The knit file can be an html, word, or pdf document (please choose one and do not submit it in multiple formats). 

Note that you must upload BOTH files BEFORE you hit "submit" in the LMS; if you try to submit them one at a time, it will only allow you to upload one. I will not accept submissions via email (unless there are extenuating circumstances). Also, you are responsible for reviewing the files before uploading (check formatting, typos, output, etc.). Additionally, please be sure to review all instructions on the assignment pdf. **There will be a penalty for submissions not meeting these requirements.**
