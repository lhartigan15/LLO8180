## Welcome to Applied Statistics (LLO8180), Spring 2021

This is a supplementary page for Professor Hartigan's section of LLO 8180 - Applied Statistics. Make sure you bookmark and check this page frequently for the most up-to-date files to use for live sessions and assignments. You should have R and RStudio installed prior to the first day of class. Instructions for installing/updating can be found [here](./Downloading Installing Updating R and RStudio.pdf).

### Live Session RStudio (.Rmd) Files
These are the RStudio files and datasets that we will use for our live session meetings each week. While you don't have to run the code in advance of class, some of you might prefer to do so. I will upload all code at least 24 hours before our class meetings.
1. Week 1 - [Introduction Rmd File](./Week 1_Introduction to R.Rmd)
    * [Plotting a prettier histogram Rmd](./Week 1_plotting a prettier histogram.Rmd)
2. Week 2 - [Summary/Descriptive Statistics Rmd File](./Week 2_Summary Statistics.Rmd), [Week2 Data File](./week2data.txt)
3. Week 3 - [Normal Probabilities and Z-Scores Rmd File](./Week 3 - Normal Prob and Z-Scores.Rmd)

### Polling Questions (with answers)
Answers to in-class polling questions (updated after each class session).
* [Week 2 Polling](./Week 2 Polling.docx)
* [Week 3 Polling](./Week 3 Polling.docx)

### Formula Slides
* [Week 2 Formulas](./Week 2 Formulas.pptx)
* [Week 3 Formulas](./Week 3 Formulas.pptx)

### Assignments
Each assignment (problem set) is worth 100 points. The problem sets should be uploaded to the async before live session on their given due date. All assignment submissions should include two files:
1. Your .Rmd code file
2. Your "knit" assignment file. The knit file can be an html, word, or pdf document (please choose one and do not submit it in multiple formats). 

There may be a penalty for submissions not meeting these requirements.

| File      | Due Date          |
